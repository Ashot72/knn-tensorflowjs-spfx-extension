This is a [KNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNN) (k-nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm) [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) [SharePoint Framework (SPFx) extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/extensions/overview-extensions).
You can test your data using training and testing sets, make real predictions and plot. I demonstrate both Classification and Regression problems and discuss Min-Max Normalization vs Z-Score Standardization.

To get started.
